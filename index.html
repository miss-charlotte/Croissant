    <h2>Here's something about croissants</h2>
    <p>
      Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is
      layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then
      rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process
      results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
      <br />
      <br />
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity. The modern croissant was
      developed in the early 20th century, when French bakers replaced the
      brioche dough of the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough
